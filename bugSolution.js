The solution involves adding more robust error handling to catch potential exceptions during data writes and also double-checking the Firebase security rules, ensuring there are no implicit blocks preventing writes, even those that may seem allowed at a glance.  Here's how you can improve the code:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
firebase.database().ref('/myPath').set(myData).catch(error => {
  console.error('Firebase data write failed:', error);
  // Add appropriate error handling logic
});
```

Furthermore, verify that security rules allow writes to the desired location, paying close attention to the data structure and any wildcards or conditional statements used.  Incorrectly configured security rules can lead to unexpected silent failures.
