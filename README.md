# Silent Firebase Data Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firebase where data writes can fail silently even when security rules appear correctly configured. The issue is characterized by a lack of error messages, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`
4. Observe the console; data write will fail silently. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining and potentially tightening Firebase security rules, ensuring they explicitly allow the write operations in question. Additional logging to catch potential errors during write operations is also recommended.
